# Abstract

In Morocco, many startups and companies opt for expensive third-party software to analyze resumes and match them with job offers. To address this challenge, we have developed a comprehensive and cost-effective in-house solution. Our system leverages advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to streamline the recruitment process. 

HR professionals can easily upload resumes in PDF format, and our system utilizes pdfminer to extract the text content. The powerful GPT-3.5Turbo language model is then employed to accurately extract relevant skills from the resumes and compile them into an easily accessible array.

Additionally, we have created a custom BERT-based model that efficiently classifies job offers into specific domains, such as data science or software engineering, based on the listed skills. This improved classification process enhances the candidate-job matching, leading to more accurate and relevant recommendations.

Furthermore, our system includes an intuitive HR chatbot that interacts with HR professionals. Powered by the GPT-3.5Turbo model, the chatbot provides valuable insights about candidate skillsets and offers personalized job recommendations. 

The entire system operates within the company's infrastructure, ensuring data security and privacy. By eliminating the need for third-party services, our solution offers cost-effectiveness and self-reliance, revolutionizing the recruitment process for Moroccan companies.
